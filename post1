With many false starts I am going at it again. I want to write and share my stream of consciousness. I want to share what I have learned with plant medicines. I want to speak. I want to create. I want to teach. I want to share my thoughts. 

So this blog will be where I host my blog posts and podcasts. While I continue to build an NFT / blockchain collection.

I think the best place to start is to tell my story. In short, I was born in Estonia. My mom and dad, new rich from Russia. Mentally unstable. Threw money at me so they didn't have to care for me. I used 10 years of plant medicines, worked with shamans and healers, was initiated into a spirituality by a 106 year old medicine man and second initation with their chief. got married to the first woman i slept with then inherited the apartment. Was harassed by mother. Betrayed by family. And now I'm healing and holding my vibe and giving my all to go all in on my dreams. 

I want to share this wisdom through my writing, through my podcast / youtube / music + I want to create a dao / nft collection for my tribe.
