  <h2>Masterplan Part 1 Draft</h2>
  <p>

<h3>This is my 10 year vision for my life</h3>

<p>Could be viewed as all my life’s vision. Some fundamentals and values will not change. Goals and dreams might.</p>

<p>The first half of this is just a list of my principles and some maxims that I believe in. The second part is a list of my goals, dreams and vision.</p>

<p>It’s a raw draft. I realise that I know my aim but I can’t be super sure what will even happen in the next 6 months let alone in the next 10 years. So this draft is not perfect. It’s a work in progress.</p>

<h3>Who do I want to become?</h3>

Pay attention what you pay attention to!

I would like to record my life! Like eva zu beck, dhh, mr beast, sorelle - to look back one day and have it recorded for myself and my family. For Tiger it was simple - the best golfer. I want to live a great life and pursue my curiosities and create my dream life. 

I am inspired by dhh, zuck, elon, sorelle, palmer luckey, kim dotcom, tobi lutke, david senra and sorelle amore - I also noticed that Balaji wrote about eth flag rising on wall street and for some reason it made me think of coding, business, dominance and got me excited.* 

————————————

I will start with principles that I believe to be true. That I can also come back to and revisit. They can be divided into 3 sub categories - Life, Work and Health

Life

- WINNING IS THE MAIN THING! KEEP THE MAIN THING THE MAIN THING!
- Systems over goals
- Discipline is the way 
- My life focus is on happiness, health, family and work - nothing else matters at this point. 
- Best jobs are creative expressions of continous learners in free markets. Get ahea by being a perpetual learner. 
- Do things my way - if it works and is exciting, people will follow
- Dogged persistence and excitement!
- Hell yes or no - to projects, people, ideas, etc. 
- The more you know the less you diversify
- Suffer for 1 thing - cultivate a desire and visualize success - every step of the way
- I decide what is important to me, do and learn everything about it, prioritise it above all else 
- go after your life with energy and passion - what is my purpose?! - what is my destiny ?! 
- people are motivated by fear and self-interest
- Spend time with my family - that is what life is all about! Family, health, work, purpose. I am grateful to have a family!
- every evening write down the things i want to do the next day + read my dreams / goals / aspirations
- metta meditation - may i be full of love and kindness, well, happy, at ease
- How can I achieve my 10 year vision in 6 months?
- Optimism is a moral duty!
- There will always be room for a man with energy and imagination 
- The man who can successfully implemnt new ideas into new products and services
- Business is just an idea to that makes someones life better
- Be useful!

Work

- If you don’t know what to work on the most important thing is to figure it out!
- Pursue excitement! 
    - It’s exciting to have my own dream locations around the world like four seasons but my own high quality
    - Building a personal brand - a by product of what i do to add value and 
- Start with what’s best for the customer and work backwards
- If you’re going through hell, the work is the way.
- Optimize for independence and control - Dyson still holds 100% of his company. Although Buffet doesn’t but they maintain control. So does DHH at Basecamp because they bootstrapped their company.
- Money comes naturally if you focus on service and making and excellent product
- Don’t wait to do work that I love - do it now!
- Main value proposition to the people - focus only on that, repeat it - iPod - “1000 songs in your pocket.”
- If I don’t love it you won’t do it all the time and you will not be the best —> someone else will outplay me.
- Most pains come from suffering in short term so that you can get paid in long term
- Find out what to do - what i am uniquely qualified to do - what sercice or product ic an provide the world that can only come from me
- you can get rich by providing society what it wants but does not know how to get at scale
- pecific knowledge is found by pursuing my geniune curiosity - it will feel like play to me!!!!!!! BUFFET IS A GREAT EXAMPLE - judgement, leverage, specific knowledge, working on the right things, compounding
- my aspirational hourly rate?!
- mr beast outsourced everything - just work on youtbe
- work as hard as i can even though what i work on and with whom is much more important
- become the best in the world @ what i do - keep redefining what i do until this is true - then i will do it for everyone
- productise yourself - yourself has uniqueness and productise is leverage - it’s hard, takes decades, executing and figuring out what i can uniquley provide. 
- escape comptetiton through authenticity - a non comoditized product - build a monopoly of one - then find scale after i figure out what i can uniquley provide
- am 100% into it?!?!?!?! if not then someone who is will out perform me
- don’t copy the what copy the how
- FIGURE OUT WHAT I CAN PROVIDE FOR SOCIETY THAT IT DOES NOT KNOPW HOW TO GET BUT SOCIETY WANTS IT AND PROVIDING ITI SNATURAL TO ME WITHIN MY SKILLSET AND CAPABILITIES - THEN SCALE IT 
- steve jobs ego needs and personal drives led to seek fulfillment from - “building innovative products and building a lasting company!
- control my own message - my own media company like bloomberg, elon (twitter d2c to people), senra, tim, dhh, 
- GET GOOD AT MARKETING - IT’S A MORAL OBLIGATION - MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF MY COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND THEIR EXISTENCE

- Borrowed money must be repaid
- Seek untapped or underexploited markets
- Guarantees should be honored in customers favor - be reliable

How to do work you love by Paul Graham

The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.

Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it.

What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious!

If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.

Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness.

But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.

The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way.

I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach "staying upwind." This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.

The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on? When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older.

Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.

There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come.

Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.

And that is what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good.
