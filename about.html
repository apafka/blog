			<h1>My Story</h1>

			<h2>Entrepreneur & Builder in Web 3.0</h2>

			I've built multiple businesses from fat loss teas to ice-cream stands and designer accessories.
		<p>
			I'm currently focused coding, writing and speaking about plant medicines while also building in Web 3.0, Blockchain and crypto.
		<p>
			<h2>Musician Healer Shaman</h2>
		<p>
			A decade worth of spiritual transformations and rebirth with master plants brought forth the musician within me. I love playing the guitar and singing. I dream of hosting my own ceremonies and concerts to share joy and entheogenic wisdom from master plants.
		<p>
			<h2>Plant medicine advocate</h2>
		<p>
			Plant medicines have been used ceremonially for thousands of years. I've walked this path for over a decade. I've had mentors from different indigenous lineages. From the Native Americans Peyote healers to Ayahuasca shamans with whom I've had the blessing to receive deep spiritual intiations and healings.
		<p>
			Thousands of ceremonies and diets. Initiations by a 106 year shaman and tirbe chiefs.
		<p>
			I've traveled the world and followed my dreams to go to Mongolia and & climb the sacred mountain Burkhan Khaldun where Chinggis Khan would pray before fulfilling his destiny.
		<p>
			Why all this? To get the energy of these places and hold it to share it with the right seekers.
		<p>
			I didn't know it at the time but me running from ceremony to ceremony brought a lot of healing, wisdom, insight and blessings into my life. I used to be suicidal. My energy was blocked and nothing didn't seem to work for me. I had a lot of mental illnesses and plants helped me see through these illusions..
		<p>
			I believe that these plants should be legalized to guide our society and culture towards a brighter future. I want to do my best to help this paradigm shift happen.
		<p>
			<h2>Family man</h2>
		<p>
			I'm married to Jennifer and we are parents to a beautiful angel named Ze. Praying for many more children to be born into our family. We also have an awesome cat and dog.
		<p>
			Only joy üôèüèºüíô‚ú®
