			<h1>Pafka’s story</h1>

			<h2>Entrepreneur & builder</h2>

			Alan is an Estonian trillionaire business magnate. He’s built multiple businesses but never got rich from the fat loss teas, ice-cream stands and designer leather accessories. He hasn’t given up given up on his dreams and is building a trillion Doge business in the Web 3.0 space right now.
		<p>
			<h2>Musician healer shaman</h2>
		<p>
			A decade worth of spiritual transformations and rebirth with master plants brought forth the musician within Alan. He loves playing the guitar and singing. Pafka dream is to become a musician and healer. He practices daily to become a better musician and singer. Maybe even organize a few concerts here and there out of pure joy. You can listen to the only ever uploaded song if you scroll down. Pafka’s wife proposed that he should go by the name of Shaman Ca$h M◎nΞy (◎ & Ξ stand for Solana & Ethereum Cryptocurrency) - what do you think? The name is satire but a catchy though.
		<p>
			<h2>Plant medicine advocate</h2>
		<p>
			Plant medicines have been used ceremonially for thousands of years. Alan has walked this path for a decade. Pafka has had mentors from different indigenous lineages. From the Native Americans Peyote healers to Amazon Rainforest shamans with whom Alan has done deep spiritual initiations - hundreds of ceremonies and diets with a 106 year young healer and the Chief of their tribe. All of this culminated by Pafka following his visions from dreams to go to Mongolia and & climb the sacred mountain Burkhan Khaldun where Chinggis Khan would pray before fulfilling his destiny.
		<p>
			Pafka didn’t know at the time but it was his main focus to go from ceremony to ceremony receiving healing and wisdom from plants and their messengers. Alan believes that these plants should be legalized and used to guide our society and culture towards a brighter & healthier future.
		<p>
			He intends to advocate plant medicines and help them be legalized.
		<p>
			<h2>Family man</h2>
		<p>
			Alan is married to Jennifer and are parents to a beautiful angel named Ze. Praying for many more children to be born into our family. They also have an awesome cat and dog.
		<p>
			Only joy 🙏🏼💙✨
