<h2>How is Elon so effective / productive?</h2>

<h2>How Elon Operates</h2> 
<p> - Incredible devotion from the leader of the company to fully deeply understand what the company does and be completely knowledegable of every aspect what the company does and be in the trenches and talking directly to the people who do the work and be the lead problem solver in the organisation </p>
<p> - shows up every week in his companies --> identifies the biggest problem the company is having that week --> fixes it --> does that for 52 weeks a year </p>
<p> - incredible intellectual capability + forceful personality + moral authority + focus on fundamentals + execution capability </p>

<h2>Elon Method</h2> 
<p> - delegates almost everything --> </p>
<p> - not involved in most of the things his companies are doing --> </p> 
<p> - he is involved in the thing that is the biggest problem **righ now until that thing is fixed** </p>
<p> - then he doesn't have to be involved anymore and can go focus on the next big thing that is the biggest problem right now </p>
<p> - rinse and repeat </p>

<h2>Bottleneck concept</h2> 
<p> In manufacturing chain there is always some bottleneck -- something that is keeping the manufacturing line from running the way it should be running. </p>

<p> Sometimes it's at the beginning of the manufacturing chain like we can't get enough raw materials. Sometimes it's at the end, like we don't have enough warehouse space for the finished product. Or the bottleneck is somewhere in the middle. </p>

<p> If you're running a manufacturing company, there's always a bottleneck. Whatever the bottleneck, it's holding everything up. Job number one is to remove that bottleneck and get everything again. </p>

<p> Elon has basically univesilized that concept and looks at every company like its some sort conceptual assembly line and every given week there is a bottleneck. Guaranteed to be one main thing one main bottleneck that is holding people back. </p>

<p> He then micromanages the solution of **that.** He doesn't need to manage anything else because everything else is running better than that and can focus on that. </p>

<p> Once he understands the bottleneck then Elon goes and talks to the line engineers who understand the technical nature of the bottleneck. </p>

<p> For me personally it's having enough income and finances to live freely on my own terms. The root problem is avoiding experiments to figure out work I love and build stuff / wealth / products / sell. </p>
