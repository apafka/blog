  <p>I've had this dream of building a business for a nearly two decades. I never believed in myself. Then I found plant medicines aka psychedelics. They lead me to god. Or in other words, I found god through them. Then I started to believe. </p>

<p>This podcast is a dedication to that journey and the joruney onwards.  </p>
