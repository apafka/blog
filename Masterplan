  <h2>Masterplan Part 1 Draft</h2>
  <p>

**26.07 - 10 year goal / vision break down** - Objective - Achieve dream life --> Key results:

**Principles** - Discipline is the way. Every day, 7 days a week. **Systems over gaols**.
- Deep work session first thing in the morning. - use deep work session 4 hours or 90 minute sessions (3x28 min and 2 min rest) - each session with different focus (writing/content; clients; new skill development)
- Then work out - run / cycle / gym.
- Take dogs to the forest
- hang out with my family - what a blessing it is to have family!
- **every evening write down the things i want to do the next day + read my dreams / goals / aspirations** choose one 80/20% 
- Errands, maybe 1x a week or all after the above. 
- It's important to do things fast - A week is 2% of the year
- I also noticed how when i thought of coding and ai and programming that is when an acorn fell and i heard it.
- All this will develop into craft, skills, business. Define my mission and purpose. Purpose is to do good in this world. Stand for my values. protect my children. 
- make a lot of stuff
- choosing new projects - new relationships, new skills, excitement, life energy

- get better at contiuing the momentum with the good habits (work in the morning + workout later + dogs in forest + family)
- don't waste money. work in car / beach / recset or laulasmaa spa get tea - eat at home
