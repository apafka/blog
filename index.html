  <h2>Now</h2>
  <p>Inpsired by Derek Sivers, this is what I'm up to now. I am inspired to become a full stack engineer and a full stack creator. Mostly, I want to build a business inspired by Basecamp and Shopify while also sharing my wisdom and music about plant medicines and spirituality. I am also raising a family, traveling and going for my dreams. Those dreams are to be free, healthy, financially and location independent.</p> 
	  
  <h2>Family man</h2>
  <p>I'm married to Jennifer. We have a big family. Our daughter, baby son, two dogs and four cats. </p>
