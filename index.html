  <p>I welcome emails to <a href="mailto:pafka@hey.com">pafka@hey.com</a>. You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/alanpafka">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQqglbaQNvM-RGnOSX1VuIw">YouTube</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>Now</h2>
  <p>Inpsired by Derek Sivers, this is what I'm up to now. I am inspired to become a full stack engineer and a full stack creator. Mostly, I want to build a business inspired by Basecamp and Shopify while also sharing my wisdom and music about plant medicines and spirituality. I am also raising a family, traveling and going for my dreams. Those dreams are to be free, healthy, financially and location independent.</p> 
	  
  <h2>Family man</h2>
  <p>I'm married to Jennifer. Together we have four kids - our baby daughter, two dogs and a cat. </p>

  <p>I've been vlogging on YouTube for some time now. My initial goals to learn to be a better public speaker, share what I've healed with plant medicines, be as transparent as I possibly had the balls to be and to ship as often as I could. Also, for over a decade I've been on a journey with plant medicines. I've healed a lot of trauma and inspired me to play the guitar and chant.</p>
