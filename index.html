  <article>
  <p>I share my thoughts regularly on my <a href="https://world.hey.com/pafka">newsletter</a> and welcome emails to <a href="mailto:pafka@hey.com">pafka@hey.com</a>.
  <p>You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/alanpafka">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQqglbaQNvM-RGnOSX1VuIw">YouTube</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>Now</h2>
  <p>Inpsired by Derek Sivers, this is what I'm up to now. I am raising a family, I'm renting out real estate and I am trying to make it by learning to code, building a business, YouTube'ing and writing.</p> 
  
  <h2><a href="https://alanpafka.com/blog.html">Blog</a></h2>
  <p>I like to write a little bit every day. Writing helps me clarify my thoughts about life, my projects and is enjoyable to me in general. Whether I'm using a physical journal, writing on my newsletter or here in my blog.</p>
	  
  <h2>Family man</h2>
  <p>I'm married to Jennifer. Together we have four kids - a human daughter, two dogs and a cat. ðŸ˜Š</p>	  
	  
  <h2><a href="https://spiritualwinner.com">Spiritual Winner</a></h2>
  <p>Spiritual Winner is my passion project to help other seeking souls to live a better life by sharing my thoughts about spirituality and plant medicines through audio and video.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQqglbaQNvM-RGnOSX1VuIw">YouTube and Vlogging</a></h2>
  <p>I've been vlogging on YouTube for some time now. My initial goals to learn to be a better public speaker, share what I've healed with plant medicines, be as transparent as I possibly had the balls to be and to ship as often as I could.</p>  
  
  <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfqvZWAASlg">Music, Spirituality & Shamanism</a></h2>
  <p>For over a decade I've been on a journey with plant medicines. I've healed a lot of trauma and inspired me to play the guitar and chant.</p>
