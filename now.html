<h2>Now</h2>

<h2>How Elon Operates</h2> 
<p>Inpsired by Derek Sivers, this is what I'm up to now. I am inspired to become a full stack engineer and a full stack creator. Mostly, I want to build a business inspired by Basecamp and Shopify while also sharing my wisdom and music about plant medicines and spirituality. I am also raising a family, traveling and going for my dreams. Those dreams are to be free, healthy, financially and location independent.</p>
