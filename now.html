<h2>NOW PAGE</h2>
<p>
This is my now page
<p>
Right now I'm living with my family and raising our baby daughter.
<p>
I'm also learning to code, building this website and building in the Web 3.0 Space.
<p>
I love guitar and singing. I value health. I practice these every day. Their in my morning routine - work outs and singing.
<p>
I'm also on an infinite journey of spiritual growth. Much love and light to ya'll.

Most websites have a link that says “about”. It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business. For short, people just call it an “about page”.
<p>
Most websites have a link that says “contact”. It goes to a page that tells you how to contact this person or business. For short, people just call it a “contact page”.
<p>
So a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.
