<article>
  <p>Living life principles that I've thought through deeply helps me keep me centered. I guess as I write this I'm not in the mood of writing as much as    I am on just getting this page up and running. Anyhow I will share some principles.</p>
    
  <p>Keeping my childhood home where my daughter was born, passing it on as inheritance, not selling it, bootstrapping, etc. </p>
	  	  
<h2>3. Decision Making Framework</h2>
  <p>Making good decisions is a skill that can be practiced. I go through this mental decision framework, whether a fast decision or a more considered one.</p>

<h3>3.0 Exitement, skills, network</h3>
 <p>Does this thing what I am embarking on excite me, bring me joy, does it improve my life, grow my network and develop any new skills?</p>
	  
<h3>3.1. First Principles</h3>
<p>If the decision touches one of the core principles, then follow the principles. Easy. Otherwise, go through the decision framework.

<h3>3.2. Small vs Big</h3>
 <p>The first thing to determine is the size or impact of the decision.</p> 

 <p>Small decision, make it quickly or delegate it, and move on. Things like where to go for dinner, or a small investment.</p> 

 <p>Big decisions, gather data, discuss in a group, and then sleep on it for 24 hours. Like big sponsorships, investments, etc.</p> 

<h3>3.3. Reversible vs Permanent</h3>
 <p>Some decisions are reversible, like developing a new product feature. You can always stop at any time and then working on something else or turn it off after it is complete. There will be some sunk cost on time and energy, but it’s limited.</p> 

 <p>Some decisions are not easy to reverse, like a big up front payment for a sponsorship deal, M&A of a large company that we plan to integrate with our team, etc.</p> 

<h3>3.4. Do I Have Expertise?</h3>
 <p>If it is something I know well, or have background information, things like tech, product, then I can make decisions more quickly. In areas I don’t know well, like marketing, I would either have to delegate or involve other experts or make the decisions more carefully.</p> 

<h3>3.5. Sufficient Information</h3>
 <p>The last thing to ask is, do I/we have sufficient information. For small decisions, I don’t need a lot of information. For large ones, we should try to get the necessary information we can. But at the end of the day, we often have to make decisions with limited information.</p> 

 <p>Lastly: it is usually much better to make a decision then execute than not making a decision.</p> 
	
<h3>3.5. Gut Feeling</h3>
	
<p>How does my body feel about this decision? If my body starts to get tight and my "spider-sense" tells me something's wrong then I don't move forward with that decison. I trust my spider-sense.</p>
