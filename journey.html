  <p>This book was inspired by a client. I was driving the equivalent of Uber. Like a taxi driver. My first client in a long time, I mean I hadn’t driven for 6 months or so and I just drove with the intention to put some energy in motion. And boy did I put it the energy in motion. </p>
  
	<p>The guy sat in my car and started cursing, fuck, it’s difficult to get in. He was a cripple but he was 80 years old. A mathematician who had built some serious software infrastructure for the Estonian government. Anyway, long story short, it was a 15 minute drive and we hit it off. We vibed and really hit it off. He told me some of his stories and I jumped in and told me about my journey with plant medicines and shamanism. He told me that I have to record these stories for my kids, and their kids and humanity over all. We really vibed with god and everything being one.  </p>
    
  <p>At the destination when he got out of the car and we parted ways, I had goosebumps. Goosebumps I hadn’t had for a long time! He also said his cousin or someone works for Elon Musk in Silicon Valley. </p>
	
  <p>“May god protect you” were his last words as we parted ways. I didn’t get an instant order again and when I stopped I saw an audi with the numberplates 940 leave. Why it matters? I’m having a trip with car plates 4 and 9. They keep surrounding me. Neighbours. I see them consistently in the city. It’s a vibration. Anyway. I went and got the book from Jaan Kaplinski, the guy he mentioned.</p>
